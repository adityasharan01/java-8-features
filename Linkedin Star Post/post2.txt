Have you ever struggled with the "the port is already in use" error while starting the application?

A lot of times when we are using multiple applications or forget to stop the previous process, we get the "the port is already in use" error.

Then we try to find the process using that port and then kill it or maybe restart the machine.

There is an easier way to do it. Just run the following command in your terminal/command prompt:

npx kill-port port_number

and the process using that port will be killed.

For example,

npx kill-port 3000

will kill the process using port 3000.

To kill multiple ports pass the ports separated by space

npx kill-port 3000 5000 7000
