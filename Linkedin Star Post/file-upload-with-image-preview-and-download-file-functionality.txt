Do you know that there is a very popular Node.js npm library with name multer using which you can upload a file of any type and any size?

And there is a downloadjs npm library that allows you to download any type of file.

By combining these two libraries you can create an application that easily allows you to upload and download any type of file.

Check out my article link in the comment with step-by-step instructions for creating an application using these two libraries.

You will also learn how to store extra data along with the file you're uploading inside the MongoDB database.

The application also allows you to upload a file by just the drag and drop feature along with the preview of the uploaded image.

For that, I'm using a very popular react-dropzone npm library.

So check out the link in the comment to create full-stack file upload/download application using MERN(MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack.
