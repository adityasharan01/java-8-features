The New Javascript API to Access a User's Local FilesðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

The new File System API changes that and creates a secure way for us to change, edit and add files on a user's computer. That means we can finally write to a user's computer from a frontend Javascript file, as long as they give us permission...âš¡âš¡ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ‘Œ

How does it work??
There are three key functions we can use with the file systems API:

ðŸ‘‰window.showSaveFilePicker - which allows us to save a file to a user's computer, which we then have read/write access to.

ðŸ‘‰window.showOpenFilePicker - which allows us to open an existing file on a user's computer, which we can then read/write to.

ðŸ‘‰window.showDirectoryPicker - which gives us access to a directory, which we can then read/write to.

These are all async compatible functions, so we can wait for a user's response to each before proceeding. If they respond by giving access via the browser's dialog boxes, then we can use the response to write directly to the user's disc...ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€

Let's look at an example. Below, we have a button which when the user clicks, will open a save file dialog. This dialog has a default suggested file name of 'Downloaded File.txt'.ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž
