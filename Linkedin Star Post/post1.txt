Do you know that you can quickly delete all the 𝗻𝗼𝗱𝗲_𝗺𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗲𝘀 folders from your system to free up some space?

When we do npm install or yarn install a node_modules folder is created which takes a lot of space and we never bother about deleting those folders.

We can always regenerate those folders so it's good to delete those which are not needed.

Just execute the following command from the terminal from inside the folder where all your projects are stored.

npx npkill

It will list out all the node_modules folders from the current folder and its subfolders.

Then you can navigate through the list by pressing up and down arrow keys and just press spacebar to delete a particular node_modules folder.

Manually deleting the node_modules folder takes a lot of time. But using npkill is very fast. You just hit the spacebar and the folder is instantly deleted.

If you don't want to use the npx command, you can install the npkill npm package globally using

npm install -g npkill

and then just run npkill command from the terminal.

Just give it a try. You will love it. It's a great way to free up your disk space 🙂
